# Archetype QC  
Archetype QC is an initiative of Québec's Ministère de l'Environnement, de la Lutte contre les Changements Climatiques, de la Faune et des Parcs (MELCCFP), Concordia University, École Polytechnique de Montréal and Hydro-Québec. Ultimately, the initiative aims to develop a virtual representation (models) of Quebec's residential, commercial and institutional building stock. These models will be used to simulate various scenarios for implementing energy efficiency and flexibility measures throughout Quebec.
   
Archetype QC is organized around 3 dimensions:  
- A data library to characterize Quebec's building stock;  
- A model library for representative simulation of the building stock;  
- A platform for exploiting the above 2 libraries to address needs, mainly related to assessing the impact of implementing technologies or to forecasting future energy demand.  

To reflect this structure, this project is made up of 3 repositories on GitHub:  
- [Donnees-Data](https://github.com/Archetype-QC/Donnees-Data): repository for data library development;  
- [Modeles-Models](https://github.com/Archetype-QC/Modeles-Models): repository for model library development;  
- [Plateforme-Platform](https://github.com/Archetype-QC/Plateforme-Platform): repository for platform development.  
  
The initiative is open to all contributions from external players, in particular:  
- Donations of data representative of the Quebec building stock (residential, commercial or institutional);  
- Development of models (OpenStudio/EnergyPlus) representative of the Quebec building stock, or models derived from those already included in the model library;  
- Any other contribution of interest, etc.  
  
## License  
In each repository, 2 license files are provided: one in French and one in English. The 2 files obviously follow the same license, which is based on the Quebec Free Licenses (LiLiQ). More specifically, the license is [LiLiQ-P](https://forge.gouv.qc.ca/licence/en/liliq-p/).
